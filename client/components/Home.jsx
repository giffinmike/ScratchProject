A convincing victory based on a large turnout is essential for the President’s political plans for Mexico, while the referendum itself will be exploited by AMLO and his Morena party accolades to discredit the National Electoral Institute (INE). Both objectives reflect AMLO’s laser-like focus on reinforcing Morena’s electoral dominance – in gubernatorial elections this year and next and especially in the 2024 Presidential contest – regardless of the impact this might have on democracy in Mexico.',

Both objectives reflect AMLO’s laser-like focus on reinforcing Morena’s electoral dominance – in gubernatorial elections this year and next and especially in the 2024 Presidential contest – regardless of the impact this might have on democracy in Mexico.',
